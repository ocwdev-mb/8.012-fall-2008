Sir Isaac Newton developed classical mechanics in the 17th century not just as a mathematical approach to understanding the motions of objects, but also as an experimental science. His book [Principia](http://books.google.com/books?id=XJwx0lnKvOgC&printsec=frontcover) details many experiments used to test the equations he derived from various force laws.

In lieu of a lab, we have designed an assignment which allows you to decide what kind of experiment or investigation in classical mechanics you want to pursue. This project is open-ended; you decide what project you want to do — measure a physical constant, reproduce one of the homework problems, do a numerical simulation of a complex physical problem — and propose your project to the instructors. Once you get the go ahead, go for it! The 8.012 Project is worth 5% of your final grade.

Here are the rules:

*   The project must an experiment based on principles we have learned in 8.012.
*   The project should test an idea (such as the conservation of momentum), verify a result from the psets (such as confirming the properties of the capstan), recreate a classical experiment (such as those conducted by Newton or Galileo); demonstrate a physical concept (similar to the classroom demos) or examine a unique mechanical situation (such as examining the motion of coupled-pendulum system).
*   The project can be mechanical (i.e., building something), purely experimental (i.e., measuring the motion of a simple system) or numerical (i.e., simulating a physical problem on computer).
*   You may work in groups of up to 4 people.
*   Each project will be graded according to its description of the physics underlying the experiment, design and execution of the experiment and analysis/description of the results. Creativity will be rewarded!

The first step is to submit a project proposal, a one (1) page description of your proposed project which is due in Lec #14. That proposal should include:

*   A title and name(s) of those working on the project;
*   A brief description of the project itself (general idea, design, goals);
*   A description of how the project is specifically related to the physical principles discussed in 8.012; and
*   A description of the resources you may need to complete the project and how you aim to obtain those resources.

The instructors will assess your project idea and either give you/your group the go-ahead or suggest a revised project plan. No 8.012 project can be done without an accepted proposal, and no late proposals will be accepted, so be sure to get your proposals in Lec #14. Only one proposal per group needs to be turned in; if your group spans multiple recitations, please designate one (responsible!) member of your group to hand in the proposal.

Once your proposal is accepted, go for it! Completed projects, consisting of a 3-5 page report and any accompanying media (e.g., pictures, video, computer simulation) will be due by the end of Lec #21. The best projects will be highlighted on the last day of lecture.

Not sure what to do? Here are some examples of previous projects:

*   A simulation of the orbit of a sun, planet and moon
*   A simulation of an object bound by two springs
*   A machine that measures friction
*   A multi-stage pendulum bar
